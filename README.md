# Project Layout

An SST app is made up of two parts.

- `lib/` - App Infrastructure
  the code that describes the infrastructue of your serverless app is placed in the `lib/` directory of your project. SST uses `AWS CDK`, to create the infrastructure.
- `src/` - App Code
  The lambda function code that's run when your API is invoked is placed in the src/ directory of your porject.

## Create an SST APP

Later on we'll be adding a `frontend/` directory for our frontend React app.
